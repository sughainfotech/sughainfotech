    <h3>How Engagement Starts</h3>
    <p>
      We begin with a <strong>Free Cloud Assessment</strong> to understand your
      current cloud setup, cost inefficiencies, and risk areas.
      <br><br>
      Based on this, we suggest a simple and affordable support plan tailored
      to your environment.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:15px;">
      <strong>Support plans typically start from $300–$500 per month</strong>,
      depending on environment size and scope.
      <br>
      No long-term contracts. Scale only when you are ready.
